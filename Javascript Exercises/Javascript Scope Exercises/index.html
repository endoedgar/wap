        <li>
            Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
<code><pre>x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
    var x = 10;
    document.write(x);
    document.write(a);
    var f = function(a, b, c) {
        b = a;
        document.write(b);
        b = c;
        var x = 5;
    }
    f(a,b,c);
    document.write(b);
}
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);
}</pre></code>

        <li>What is the difference between a method and function?
            <blockquote>
                A method is a function called inside an object. A function doesn't require an object.
            </blockquote>

        <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
            <blockquote>
                this in Java refers to the object which that method belongs to.
            </blockquote>

        <li>
            What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
            <blockquote>
                this in Javascript also refers to the object which that method belongs to. If there is no object, it refers to the window object.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
            <blockquote>
                this refers to the newly created object in the constructor function.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
            <blockquote><p>when f is called by x.f, this refers to the x object.</p>
                <p>when f is called by y.f, this refers to the y object.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>What is a free variable in JavaScript?
            <blockquote>A free variable is a variable that is referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables.</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
            <blockquote><code><pre>{
    name: "fred",
    major: "music",
    f: function(a, b) {
        if(a &lt; b)
            return a;
        else if(a==b)
            return a*b;
        else
            return b;
    }
}</pre></code></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields:  name, salary, position.
            <blockquote>
                <code><pre>function Employee(name, salary, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
}

let e1 = new Employee("John", 5000, "CEO");
let e2 = new Employee("Robert", 4000, "CFO");
let e3 = new Employee("Anna", 4000, "CTO");</pre></code>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments.
            <blockquote><code><pre>function f() {
    let prod = 1;
    for(let i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; ++i) {
        prod *= arguments[i];
    }
    return prod;
}</pre></code>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
            <blockquote>
                <code><pre>let f = (a, b, c) =&gt; Math.max(a,b,c)</pre></code>
            </blockquote>
