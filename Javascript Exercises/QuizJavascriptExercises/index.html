        <li>
            What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
            <div>
                <pre><code>setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);</code></pre>
                <blockquote>
                    The first one is passing booyah as a parameter to the setTimeout function. The second one is actually calling a function called booyah and whatever it returns is going to be passed as a parameter to the setTimeout function.
                </blockquote>
            </div>
        </li>

            What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            <div>
                <pre><code>var myfunc = function(a, x) {
    return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));</code></pre>
                <blockquote>
                    The first alert shows the return value of x which is myfunc(2,3) and that is 6. The second alert shows the return value of the y function which is a variable function reference to myFunc, returning actually myFunc(2,3) which is 6.
                </blockquote>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
            <pre><code>setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</code></pre>
            <blockquote>
                <code>
                    <pre>function booyah1() { alert('BOOYAH'); }
function booyah2() { return booyah1; }</pre>
                </code>
            </blockquote>

            What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
            <blockquote>
                <p>Unobtrusive Javascript is HTML with minimal Javascript inside.</p>
                <p>The practical application of it is a way to separate HTML from Logic using some DOM attachment event functions.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons for doing it is that you can keep HTML clean without Javascript mixed with it, effectively separating the website into three categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>content -> html</li>
                    <li>presentation -> css</li>
                    <li>behavior -> javascript</li>
                </ol>
